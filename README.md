# dynamic-business
this is back-end of a Low/No Code platform, Easy-BPM, for a well-known .NET CMS called DNN which you can find it on DNN store.
this platform is a business process management system which users can build a business flow/process like ticketing system, CRM, BMS and etc. In addition to the BPM features, it can be used to create forms and apps like Mendix, Kissflow. My main goal is to make a platform for developer to reduce the time of development of repetitive projects/tasks.

In this repository I have developed the Back-End of this platform base on ASP Net Web API. I used onion architecture in this project and split the project into 8 different projects to cope with the complexity of this platform
